Recipe Collection
=================

If you think about it, a recipe is nothing more than a set of instructions to
make something happen. Certainly there are some vague conventions about how
they are organized (ingredients, method) and they are usually written as a
bunch of steps. In a word, they are a procedure.

This repository contains a collection of recipes expressed as procedures in the
Technique programming language. They serve both as examples of programming in
Technique as well as being genuine real-world procedures in their own right,
used by their contributors cooking at home. We hope you enjoy!

Copyright for original recipes is retained by their contributors.
